## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### Python Dependencies
- reportlab==4.0.7 (PDF generation)
- PyPDF2==3.0.1 (PDF utilities)
- openai==1.12.0 (OpenAI API)
- anthropic==0.18.1 (Anthropic API)
- python-dateutil==2.8.2 (Date utilities)

### API Keys (Optional but Recommended)
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: For OpenAI GPT-4 content generation

- API keys are used only for the current generation
- Research content is not retained

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Maximum duration: 60 months
- PDF size may vary based on content (typically 15-25 pages)
- AI generation requires valid API key (falls back to templates without)
- References must be pre-formatted (not automatically formatted)
- Budget breakdown uses standard allocation percentages
