    "literature_review": "The field of Sciences has seen significant developments in recent years, particularly in areas related to Machine Learning Applications in Climate Change Prediction. Current research has established foundational understanding of key concepts and methodologies, yet several gaps remain.\n\nExisting studies have primarily focused on traditional approaches, with limited exploration of innovative methodologies and contemporary applications. This research builds upon this foundation while addressing identified limitations in current literature.\n\nKey theoretical frameworks relevant to this study include established models within Sciences, which provide a solid conceptual basis for investigation. However, these frameworks require extension and adaptation to address emerging challenges and opportunities in the field.\n\nThis proposal addresses these gaps by integrating multiple perspectives and employing rigorous methodological approaches. The research will contribute to ongoing scholarly discourse while providing practical insights for practitioners and policymakers.",
