### **Technical Stack**

```python
# requirements.txt
openai==1.12.0
anthropic==0.18.1
reportlab==4.0.7
PyPDF2==3.0.1
python-docx==1.1.0  # for intermediary formatting
```

**PDF Generation:**
- ReportLab for professional layouts
- Custom templates by field (sciences vs humanities formatting differs)
- Proper margins (1" all sides), line spacing (1.5-2.0), pagination

**AI Enhancement:**
- Generate literature review framework
- Expand methodology based on field best practices
- Create timeline visualization
- Suggest additional research questions

---

### **Differentiation from Existing Request**

Widget #3 asks for basic report generation. You'll beat it with:
- **Field-specific templates** (STEM proposals look different from humanities)
- **Auto-generated timeline charts** (visual Gantt chart)
- **Budget table formatting** (professional financial breakdown)
- **Citation management** (auto-format references)
- **Multiple export formats** (PDF primary, DOCX backup for editing)

---

### **Implementation Timeline (8-10 hours)**

**Hours 1-2:** Basic structure
- Input form setup
- Environment variables for API keys
- PDF template creation with ReportLab

**Hours 3-5:** AI integration
- Prompt engineering for each section
- Field-specific customization
- Literature review framework generation

**Hours 6-7:** PDF formatting
- Professional styling (fonts, spacing, headers)
- Page numbering
- Table of contents generation
- Timeline chart creation

**Hours 8-9:** Polish
- Error handling
- Sample proposals for testing
- Output validation

**Hour 10:** Testing & deployment

### **Key Features Prioritization**

**Must-have (core functionality):**
1. Professional PDF with all 9 sections
2. AI-generated executive summary
3. Field-specific formatting
4. Proper academic structure

**Should-have (competitive edge):**
1. Timeline visualization
2. Multiple citation formats (APA/MLA/Chicago)
3. Budget breakdown table
4. Literature review framework

**Nice-to-have (if time permits):**
1. DOCX export option
2. Multiple language support
3. Collaboration features
4. Template customization

### **Sample Prompt for AI Generation**

```python
f"""Generate a professional research proposal executive summary for:

Field: {field_of_study}
Title: {research_title}
Research Question: {research_question}
Methodology: {methodology}

Requirements:
- 200-250 words
- Academic tone
- Highlight significance and innovation
- Include expected impact
- Follow {proposal_type} formatting standards
"""
```

---

### **Demo Strategy**

**Before:** Student with rough research idea in bullet points

**After:** 15-page professionally formatted proposal with:
- Polished cover page
- Complete section structure
- Timeline chart
- Budget breakdown
- Formatted references

**Pitch:** "From idea to fundable proposal in 60 seconds. Stop struggling with formatting—focus on your research."

---

### **Monetization Angle**

- Free: 3 proposals/month
- Student: $9/month (unlimited proposals, basic templates)
- Professional: $29/month (unlimited, all templates, custom branding, DOCX export)
- Institution: $499/year (department license, 50 users)

---

### **Risk Assessment**

**Pros:**
- Proven demand (0.24 score)
- Clear target market (students, academics, researchers)
- Professional output impresses judges
- Aligns with hackathon PDF theme

**Cons:**
- More complex than table extractor (10 hours vs 6 hours)
- Requires excellent AI prompt engineering
- PDF formatting can be finicky

**Honest assessment:** This is the right choice if you want to showcase sophistication. The table extractor would be safer/faster, but this has higher ceiling for impact and demonstrates more technical depth.

Start with the core 4 must-have features. Add competitive-edge features only if time permits. Skip nice-to-haves entirely unless you finish early.
